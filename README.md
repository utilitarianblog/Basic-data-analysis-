## 📊 Dataset Overview

The **Iris** dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers from three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*. It includes the following features:

- **sepal_length (cm)**
- **sepal_width (cm)**
- **petal_length (cm)**
- **petal_width (cm)**
- **species** (categorical)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Iris_Data_Analysis
````

### **2. Install the Required Packages**

Install the necessary Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Analysis Script**

Execute the main script:

```bash
python Iris_Data_Analysis.py
```



## 📈 Visualizations

The analysis script generates the following visualizations:

1. **Line Chart:** Average measurements by species
2. **Bar Chart:** Comparison of average measurements
3. **Histogram:** Distribution of petal length
4. **Scatter Plot:** Sepal length vs. petal length


## 📝 Key Findings

* **Distinct Species Characteristics:** Setosa has significantly smaller petal dimensions.
* **Clear Separation:** The data is well-separated by species, making it ideal for classification tasks.
* **Useful for Machine Learning:** The clear feature separation is valuable for training ML models.
