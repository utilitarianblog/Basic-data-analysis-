## **Installing the Project Locally**

To set up and run your **Iris Data Analysis** project on your local machine, follow these steps:

---

## **Step 1: Clone the Repository (if using GitHub)**

If you have uploaded the project to GitHub, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Iris_Data_Analysis
```

Replace **<your-repository-url>** with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

---

## **Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

It’s a good practice to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects:

**For Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS/Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## **Step 3: Install the Required Packages**

Use the `requirements.txt` file to install all the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Step 4: Run the Script**

Once the dependencies are installed, run the analysis script:

```bash
python Iris_Data_Analysis.py
```

---

## **Step 5: Verify the Installation**

If the script runs without errors, you should see:

* The first few rows of the **Iris** dataset.
* Basic statistics and average measurements per species.
* Four different visualizations:

  * Line Chart
  * Bar Chart
  * Histogram
  * Scatter Plot

---

## **Step 6: Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)**

When you’re done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

---

## **Troubleshooting Installation Issues**

If you encounter errors during installation:

1. **Update Pip:**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Check Python Version:**
   Ensure you’re using **Python 3.8+**, as some packages might not support older versions.

3. **Missing Packages:**
   If a package is missing, manually install it:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
